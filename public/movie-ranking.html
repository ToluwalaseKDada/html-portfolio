<h1>Lase's Top 3 Rated Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dangal</h3>
<p>Very solid, very sound entertainment, with thumpingly good Pritam songs that make Eye of the Tiger seem like pipsqueakery. Haha. This review was by The Guardian and I can agree with it</p>
<h3>Three Idiots</h3>
<p>This movie conveys a valuable message about friendship and had interesting, funny scenes that just makes it totally enjoyable.</p>
<h3>My Name is Khan</h3>
<p>An Indian Muslim man with Asperger's syndrome takes a challenge to speak to the President of the United States seriously and embarks on a cross-country journey. It was a sad story in soeme parts but had a beautiful end to it </p>
